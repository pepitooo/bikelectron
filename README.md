# BikElectron
Personnal project to illumate rim on a bike during night, "Tron" effect

## Why this project ?
To be simple, I was not satisfy with the common lightning system. I saw on kickstarter some project with led around the rim, but it had too much constraints and it was so visible during day. Then the idea : using "glow in the dark" stickers.

## First prototype
The [first prototype](https://github.com/pepitooo/OpenSCAD_leds_support) was not too bad, using a flashlight from DX.com or AliExpress and some glow in the dark tape.

I was not so happy with the size of each led support and fix system was not good at all.

# Project parts

## Electronic
It's so basic, 2 times a resitor and a UV/blacklight led in parallel.

## Battery pack
I took a battery pack used to charge phone, it's cheap, and powerfull enough.
I used a USB cable for wiring all modules togeter.

## Stickers
I used glow in the dark vinyl warp and lazer cut it. If you are precise enough cisor can do the job.

You need to sold in serial 2 led module for each wheel using the USB cable.
On the picture of the final product the front wheel is more blue than rear, it's because I bought some blue glow in the dark tape. 

I used the stickers lazer cut for the front wheel, and for the rear wheel it's from the [first prototype](https://github.com/pepitooo/OpenSCAD_leds_support) where I used 10mm tape, and cut in a lot of small piece to cover all the rim.

If you want to do the same, take a good quality glow in the dark viny to have a shiny light. The chinese seller use hour of light after illumination as "quality" take one with at least 12 hours.
