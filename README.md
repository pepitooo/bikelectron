# BikElectron
Personnal project to illumate rim on a bike during night, "Tron" effect

## Why this project ?
To be simple, I was not satisfy with the common lightning system. I saw on kickstarter some project with led around the rim, but it had too much constraints and it was so visible during day. Then the idea : using "glow in the dark" stickers.

## First prototype
The [first prototype](https://github.com/pepitooo/OpenSCAD_leds_support) was not too bad, using a flashlight from DX.com or AliExpress and some glow in the dark tape.

I was not so happy with the size of each led support and fix system was not good at all.

# Project part

## Electronic
It's so basic, 2 times a resitor and a UV led in parallel.

## Battery pack
I took a battery pack used to charge phone, it's cheap, and powerfull enough.
I used a USB cable for wiring all modules togeter.

## Stickers
I used glow in the dark vinyl warp and lazer cut it. If you are precise enough cisor can do the job.
